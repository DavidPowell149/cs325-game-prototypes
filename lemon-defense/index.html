<h2>Lemon Defense</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Defend the world's last lemon against a horde of kittens!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I didn't use any of the themes
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The rush of defending yourself against an army. Just like Gandalf would've done.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use your mouse to aim, and click to throw water in that direction. If you hit a kitten, it will die. Kill the kittens before they touch the lemon and hurt him!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A defense mechanic, where a player defends himself or another object against an enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My game has personality and a lot of heart.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The world's last lemon has decided he can best protect himself in the middle of a field, so that's where he has stationed himself.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Kittens like to eat lemons. Everyone knows this.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Children.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 45 seconds to play if you're bad. Good players can make it last a minute or so.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Does anyone even read this? One strategy is to git gud.
</li>
