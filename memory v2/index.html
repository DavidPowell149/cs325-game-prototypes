<h2>Text Defense</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Test your memory skills by correctly typing the sequences shown to you.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I did not use any of the optional themes provided.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input. More random. Play style is other: memory game
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel pressed for time, trying to memorize as many characters as they can.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The core mechanic is memorization. Players try to memorize as many characters in the sequence as possible, and then try to recreate it in the text field. The game is simple, but gets more difficult the longer you play it. The sequences get longer, and the amount of time you get to analyze it gets shorter.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This game is prototyping a basic memory mechanic. Does the mechanic work as intended, lending itself towards a overall enjoyable and fun gaming experience?
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Something very unique about this game is the text input. It was very difficult to get it to work, and I don't think games from other students feature such a mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game does not have any characters.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game does not have a story surrounding it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game could be played by anyone, but will most likely be enjoyed most by people who are fond of memory games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game does not have a set end point, but it takes about 3-5 minutes to reach the most difficult stage of sequences.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
A player could visually memorize the placement of the letters, try saying them outloud to gneerate an audible pattern, or create a pneumonic device.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets except for the ones listed here were made from scratch.
<ul>
    <li>Knight: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/knight-sprite">Knight Sprite</a></li>
    <li>Sword sound: <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/audione/sounds/52458/">sword-01</a></li>
    <li>Error sound: <a href="https://freesound.org/people/Mick%20Gibbs/sounds/249713/">Error</a></li>
    <li>Scream sound: <a href="http://www.freesound.org/people/estefaniabonnin/sounds/219864/">Scream</a></li>
    <li>Background: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/castle-background">Castle Background</a></li>
    <li>Text input: Modified from <a href="https://github.com/orange-games/phaser-input">phaser-input</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
"Simon Says" could perhaps be a game closely related to this one. The concept of using memory as a game mechanic has been used before in different ways.
