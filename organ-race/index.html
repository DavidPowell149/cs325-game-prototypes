<h2>Organ Race</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Avoid the walls and collect the blood cells.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Organ doner
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Mouse
Randomness: mostly random
Play style: Collector
Genres: Racing; Overhead; Side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have a rush as they collect blood cells and avoid walls.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Press the up and down arrow keys to move your heart. Collect the blood cells while avoiding the walls.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The movement mechanic. I designed my own acceleration and implemented it.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
I think the theme of the game is unique and fun. You're sort of playing at a microscopic scale.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in a blood vessel, with the heart trying to be <i>very</i> proactive and get its own blood cells.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The heart realized it wasn't getting enough blood. So it willed its host to take a heart shrinking pill. Now the heart traverses its own blood vessels, and actively seeks out blood cells to keep itself healthy.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is for all audiences.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Average play time could be a little less than a minute. It can be difficult to bypass some of the wall orientations.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Planning ahead and building up some acceleration will seperate the A and B players.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Other than the assets I made myself, I used these:
<ul>
<li>Heart: <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/human-heart">Human Heart</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not borrow code or base my game off of an existing project.
