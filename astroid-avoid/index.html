<h2>Astroid Avoid</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Click on the astroids to destroy them before they reach our beautiful planet.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
"Astroid heading towards Earth"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The only input for the prototype is a mouse click. The astroids fall at random from the top of the screen. The play-style is a simple point and click defense game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to experience the satisfaction of destroying the astroids, but the fear of losing the planet.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The core mechanic of the game is to click on astroids as they come into view. Clicking on an astroid destroys it. If an astroid reaches earth, earth will lose health based off of how large the astroid was.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating the fun-factor of clicking on objects to protect one's own resources.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
My prototype has ambient music, interesting sprites, and a responsive health counter.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This abstract prototype is relatively simple in terms of story. Astroids are heading towards Earth, and you (the player) wants to stop them. Hold out for as long as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A large astroid broke apart far out in space, and now its components are headed towards Earth's strong gravitational field (and tasty tropical smoothies).
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is open to all earthlings.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Average play time is roughly less than a minute before the player dies.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Sometimes players are able to destroy all the astroids all of the time. However it might be smart to prioritize larger astroids first.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I did not base my project off of any phaser example. The concept and exection was mine. Sometimes however, I did look up methods to implement a single function or varaible that already existed inside Phaser. I looked in the documentation as well as the github examples.
