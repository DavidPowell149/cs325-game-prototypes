<h2>Eavesdropper v2</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Progress incrementally by eavesdropping on the crowd and buying upgrades.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Eavesdropping
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Buttons; Randomness: Deterministic; Play style: Achiever; Genres: Incremental Game (other)
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope they get satisfaction from the constant upgrades and sense of accomplishment.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player waits to see when blue people turn red, which means they can be eavesdropped on. Click on a red person to eavesdrop, and gain a little bit of information about a conversation. Each eavesdrop will net you some money. Once you have enough tidbits, you can sell the conversation for a bonus profit. If you click on a blue person however, your bonus will reset to zero. Use your income to buy upgrades, which in turn allow you to collect money at faster rates.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Basic idle mechanics: collect a currency and invest that same currency to increase the future rate of income.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Basic idle games tend to have an automatic component, and a manual component. My manual "whack-a-mole" mechanic is not something I've personally seen done before in idle games. I've played quite a few, and I still find this fun and interesting.

What I improved from the original design:
<ul>
    Rules/Procedures/Core Mechanic Enhancements:
    <ul>
        <li>Clicking on red people gives you money, not just selling your bonus.</li>
        <li>The crowd now moves across the screen, making it more difficult to click the red people.</li>
        <li>Clicking on a blue person now resets your bonus bar back to zero, to add some difficulty.</li>
        <li>You cannot click on more red people if your bonus bar is full. You must sell the bonus first.</li>
    </ul>
    Polish Enhancements:
    <ul>
        <li>Added moving background for scenary.</li>
        <li>Added additional, meaningful sounds for clicking on blue people and for the bonus being maxed out.</li>
        <li>Rearranged some UI elements so they work with the game's new design.</li>
    </ul>


</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A man is a professional wire-tapper. He needs to collect conversations and sell them to make a living. He likes to enter dense crowds and collect as many tidbits as he can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A basic story for this prototype could simply be that he needs to listen to some conversations to make money.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored teenagers
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on how active the player is, they could probably finish the game in around 30 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are two main strategies: be very active and manual, or let the game do the work. Most players combine the strategies.
