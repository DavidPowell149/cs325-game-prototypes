<h2>Eavesdropper</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Progress incrementally by eavesdropping and buying upgrades.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Eavesdropping
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: Buttons; Randomness: Deterministic; Play style: Achiever; Genres: Idle (other)
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?

I hope they are entertained by
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player waits to see when blue people turn red, which means they can be eavesdropped on. Click on a red person to eavsdrop, and gain a little bit of information about a conversation. Once you have enough tidbits, you can sell the conversation to gain a profit. Use your income to buy upgrades, which in turn allow you to collect money at faster rates. Upgrading your conversation profit is a more manual-approach, while upgrading your dollars per second is a more idle approach.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Basic idle mechanics: collect a currency and using that same currency to increase the future rate of income.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Basic idle games tend to have an automatic component, and a manual component. My manual "whack-a-mole" mechanic is not something I've personally seen done before in idle games. I've played quite a few, and I still find this fun and interesting.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A man is a professional wire-tapper. He needs to collect conversations and sell them to make a living. He likes to enter dense crowds and collect as many tidbits as he can.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A basic story for this prototype could simply be that he needs to listen to some conversations to make money.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Bored teenagers
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Depending on how active the player is, they could probably finish the game in around 30 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are two main strategies: be very active and manual, or let the game do the work. Most players combine the strategies.
